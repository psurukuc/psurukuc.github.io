title: PROSPECT
description: PROSPECT is a short baseline reactor antineutrino experiment with precisely measure reactor antineutrino spectrum and perform sterile neutrino induced oscillation searches. While our group is not part of the experiment, Pranava played an important role on the experiment during his Ph.D. and postdoc.
#  led the R&D and assembly of optical reflector subsystem on the experiment. I also spear-headed the experiment's first sterile neutrino oscillation search.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
``` -->
