title: Project 8 
snapshot: Measuring neutrino mass
description: Neutrinos are the only fundamental particles with unknown mass. The goal of the Project 8 experiment is to precisely measure the mass of neutrinos using the Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES). On the experiment, the group's efforts are focused on the development of advanced triggering and reconstruction algorithms to improve the sensitivity of the experiment to neutrino mass.
