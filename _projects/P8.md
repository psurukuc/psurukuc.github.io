title: Project 8 
snapshot: Measuring neutrino mass
description: The goal of the Project 8 experiment is to precisely measure the mass of neutrinos using the Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES). On the experiment, my work has been primarily focused on R&D for CRES detection and reconstruction. I am currently the chair of the Antenna Array Working Group and the coordinator of the Position Track and Event Reconstruction.
