I got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago working on [PROSPECT](https://prospect.yale.edu/) reactor neutrino experiment where I led the detector fabrication and subsequently itsÂ first search for sterile neutrinos.
I then joined the [Wright Laboratory](https://wlab.yale.edu/) at Yale University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate.
