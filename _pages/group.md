    <p style="text-align: justify;">My research interests span experimental neutrino physics, rare event searches, and detector development. I am particularly interested in understanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos and their role in physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, I lead research efforts on Project 8, <a href="https://cuore.lngs.infn.it/">CUORE</a>, <a href="https://cupid.lngs.infn.it/">CUPID</a>, and <a href="https://www.project8.org/"> Project 8</a>.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago working on <a href="https://prospect.yale.edu/">PROSPECT</a> reactor neutrino experiment where I led the detector fabrication and subsequently its first search for sterile neutrinos.
    I then joined the <a href="https://wlab.yale.edu/">Wright Laboratory</a> at Yale University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate shifting my research focus neutrino mass related physics.</p>

### Tristan Hurst
**Ph.D. Student working on the CUORE and CUPID Experiments**
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> I graduated from William & Mary in 2023 with a B.S. in Physics. While there, I worked on simulations and particle identification studies for the MOLLER Experiment and realized I wanted to further pursue experimental physics. I joined the Surukuchi group in the spring of 2024 and began working on the CUORE experiment which searches for evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay. I perform data analysis and noise reduction studies on experimental data with the goal of removing environmental background noise. I have worked onsite in Italy at LNGS, the lab where CUORE is located, a few times now testing potential new noise sensors to be deployed at cryogenic temperatures. Outside of work, I enjoy singing, cooking, and biking

    <p style="text-align: justify;">I am an undergraduate student studying physics at Pitt, who is expected to graduate in 2026. In general, my primary research experience involves tackling the operational tasks of creating and running detectors. Besides working on muon detectors with Pitt-CoRTEx, I am also involved with the ATLAS detector and Vera C. Rubin Telescope as a part of Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

    I am currently a senior at Pitt and hope to one day enter graduate school in astrophysics. My research interests involve cosmology and high energy particles, particularly cosmic rays. I have attempted to gain a breadth of research experience, involving extra-galactic astrometric studies with Dr. TQ Zhang, and muon detector design and construction with Dr. Surukuchi.
    <!-- I have experience in phyton, html, java script, and C++. Much of my expertise lies in data analysis and simulations, but have recently gain experience in 3D modeling with AutoCAD.   -->
