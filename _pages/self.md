Hello, :wave: My name is Pranava. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of Pittsburgh. My research is in experimental particle physics with a focus on determining the properties of 
neutrinos
<!-- [neutrinos](/sub/resources_neutrinos) -->
--the least understood fundamental particles. I am particularly intereted in the most important unanswered questions in the Standard Model of Particles,
what is the mass of neutrinos and how they obtain mass. 

I work with researchers from throughout the world on experimental scientific collaborations to answer these incredibly hard questions.
We are aiming to build the world's most sensitive device to directly measure the mass of neutrinos on the [Project 8](https://www.project8.org/) experiment. 
<!-- I am leading the antenna design and the event reconstruction efforts on the upcoming Phase of the experiment.  -->
We are performing some of the world leading searches for neutrinoless double beta decay by using the [CUORE](https://cuore.lngs.infn.it/) and [CUPID](https://cupid.lngs.infn.it/) detectors. 

I got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago working on [PROSPECT](https://prospect.yale.edu/) reactor neutrino experiment where I led the detector fabrication and subsequently itsÂ first search for sterile neutrinos.
I then joined the [Wright Laboratory](https://wlab.yale.edu/) at Yale University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate.
