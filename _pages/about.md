Hello, thanks for stopping by! :wave: My name is Pranava. I am Postdoctoral Research Associate at Yale University working on detemining the properties of [neutrinos](/sub/resources_neutrinos)--the least understood fundamental particles.

I got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago working on the [PROSPECT](https://prospect.yale.edu/) reactor neutrino experiment leading the design, fabrication, QA, and assembly of the inner detector [subsystem](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/04/P04014) and led its [first sterile neutrino search](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.251801). Find more about [PROSPECT](/projects/PROSPECT/) and my [work](/projects/reactor) on reactor neutrinos.

I then joined the [Wright Laboratory](https://wlab.yale.edu/) at Yale University as a postdoc working on the [Project 8](https://www.project8.org/) neutrino mass experiment and [CUORE](https://cuore.lngs.infn.it/) and [CUPID](https://cupid-i.lngs.infn.it/doku.php?id=cupid_pub:start/) neutrinoless double beta decay experiments while continuing to work on the PROSPECT experiment. 
On the [Project 8](/projects/P8), I am leading the antenna design and the event reconstruction efforts on the upcoming Phase of the experiment. 
On [CUORE](/projects/CUORE) experiment, I have led the design of the muon veto system that will eventually be used for CUPID. 
I am also currently working on understanding the sources of resolution degradation to improve the sensitivity of the [CUPID](/projects/CUPID) experiment.  


<!-- This wesbite is currenlty under construction but soon it will contain information on my research interests, teaching, and other interests.
Please visit my [projects](/sub/projects) page, and my [publications](/sub/publications/) and [talks](/sub/talks) to learn more about my research interests.
You can also find more details about my [teaching philosophy](/sub/teaching_philosophy) my [teaching and mentoring](/sub/mentoring/) experience and my [training](/sub/training). -->

Please [contact](contact) me to discuss my or if you have ideas to collaborate. I particularly encourage any students in need of advice to contact me.
