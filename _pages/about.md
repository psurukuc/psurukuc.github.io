Hello, :wave: Welcome to Surukuchi group at the University of Pittsburgh. Our group's research is at the intersection of experimental particle and nuclear physics with a focus on determining the properties of neutrinos.
<!-- [neutrinos](/sub/resources_neutrinos) -->
<!-- Neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles.  -->
In particular, we focus on 
<!-- At the moment, we focus on the  intereted in the most important unanswered questions in the Standard Model of Particles,  -->
determing the magnitude and nature of neutrino mass. 

We work with researchers from throughout the world on experimental scientific collaborations to answer these incredibly hard questions. We are aiming to build the world's most sensitive device to directly measure the mass of neutrinos on the [Project 8](https://www.project8.org/) experiment. 
<!-- I am leading the antenna design and the event reconstruction efforts on the upcoming Phase of the experiment.  -->
We are performing some of the world leading searches for neutrinoless double beta decay by using the [CUORE](https://cuore.lngs.infn.it/) and [CUPID](https://cupid.lngs.infn.it/) detectors. 

<!-- I got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago working on [PROSPECT](https://prospect.yale.edu/) reactor neutrino experiment where I led the detector fabrication and subsequently itsÂ first search for sterile neutrinos.
I then joined the [Wright Laboratory](https://wlab.yale.edu/) at Yale University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. -->

<!-- **I am currently looking for motivated graduate students and postdocs** to work with me on these really cool experiments. [contact](Contact) me if you are interested to work with me or learn more about my work or neutrinos. -->
