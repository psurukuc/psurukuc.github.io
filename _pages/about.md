Hello, :wave: My name is Pranava. I am an Assitant Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of Pittsburgh. My research is in experimental particle physics with a focus on determining the properties of 
neutrinos
<!-- [neutrinos](/sub/resources_neutrinos) -->
--the least understood fundamental particles. I am particularly intereted in the most important unanswered questions in the Standard Model of Particles,
what is the mass of neutrinos and how they obtain mass. 

I work with researchers from throughout the world on experimental scientific collaborations to answer these incredibly hard questions.
We are aiming to build the world's most sensitive device to directly measure the mass of neutrinos on the [Project 8](https://www.project8.org/) experiment. 
<!-- I am leading the antenna design and the event reconstruction efforts on the upcoming Phase of the experiment.  -->
We are performing some of the world leading searches for neutrinoless double beta decay by using the [CUORE](https://cuore.lngs.infn.it/) and [CUPID](https://cupid.lngs.infn.it/) detectors. 

<!-- On [CUORE](/projects/CUORE) experiment, I have led the design of the muon veto system that will eventually be used for CUPID. 
I am also currently working on understanding the sources of resolution degradation to improve the sensitivity of the [CUPID](/projects/CUPID) experiment.   -->

<!-- I was previously a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Yale University, New Haven and prior to that got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. -->

<!-- His current work focuses on understanding the nature and magnitude of neutrino mass. He leads the antenna design and the event reconstruction efforts on the upcoming Phase of Project 8, the experiment seeking to precisely measure the neutrino mass solely using kinematics of tritium beta decay.  He is also co-supervising the latest neutrinoless double beta decay search with CUORE, the experiment to determine the mechanism behind neutrinos mass. He further heads the effort to devise and install the auxiliary measurement devices that would enable reduction in background noise in CUPID, the experimental upgrade to CUORE. -->

I got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago working on [PROSPECT](https://prospect.yale.edu/) reactor neutrino experiment where I led the detector fabrication and subsequently its first search for sterile neutrinos.
I then joined the [Wright Laboratory](https://wlab.yale.edu/) at Yale University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate.
 <!-- on the  reactor neutrino experiment leading the design, fabrication, QA, and assembly of the inner detector [subsystem](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/04/P04014) and led its [first sterile neutrino search](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.251801). Find more about [PROSPECT](/projects/PROSPECT/) and my [work](/projects/reactor) on reactor neutrinos. -->


<!-- This wesbite is currenlty under construction but soon it will contain information on my research interests, teaching, and other interests.
Please visit my [projects](/sub/projects) page, and my [publications](/sub/publications/) and [talks](/sub/talks) to learn more about my research interests.
You can also find more details about my [teaching philosophy](/sub/teaching_philosophy) my [teaching and mentoring](/sub/mentoring/) experience and my [training](/sub/training). -->

**I am currently looking for motivated graduate students and postdocs** to work with me on these really cool experiments. [contact](Contact) me if you are interested to work with me or learn more about my work or neutrinos.
