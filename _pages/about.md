Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the **Surukuchi Group** at the University of Pittsburgh. Our research is at the intersection of experimental particle and nuclear physics, with a focus on determining the fundamental properties of **neutrinos** â€” the most mysterious particles in the Standard Model.
## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

Our primary focus is on **determining the magnitude and nature of neutrino mass**. Despite being the most abundant massive particles in the universe, neutrinos remain poorly understood, making them a unique window into physics beyond the Standard Model.

We collaborate with researchers worldwide on cutting-edge experimental scientific collaborations [CUORE](https://cuore.lngs.infn.it/), [CUPID](https://cupid.lngs.infn.it/), and [Project 8](https://www.project8.org/) to tackle these fundamental questions.

<!-- I got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago working on [PROSPECT](https://prospect.yale.edu/) reactor neutrino experiment where I led the detector fabrication and subsequently itsÂ first search for sterile neutrinos.
I then joined the [Wright Laboratory](https://wlab.yale.edu/) at Yale University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. -->

<!-- **I am currently looking for motivated graduate students and postdocs** to work with me on these really cool experiments. [contact](Contact) me if you are interested to work with me or learn more about my work or neutrinos. -->
