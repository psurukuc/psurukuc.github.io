Hello, thanks for stopping by! :wave: My name is Pranava. I am Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Wright Laboratory](https://wlab.yale.edu/) at Yale University working on detemining the properties of [neutrinos](/sub/resources_neutrinos)--the least understood fundamental particles.

I am currently working on unlocking the mass of neutrinos along two parallel paths:
1. Measuring the mass of neutrinos with the [Project 8](https://www.project8.org/) experiment 
2. Searching for neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) with the [CUORE](https://cuore.lngs.infn.it/) and [CUPID](https://cupid.lngs.infn.it) experiments.

On the [Project 8](/projects/P8), I am leading the antenna design and the event reconstruction efforts on the upcoming phase of the experiment. 
On [CUORE](/projects/CUORE) experiment, I have worked on estimating the high level efficiencies in [search](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04497-4) for 0νββ and am currenlty leading the data production and high-level analyses for an improved search.
In order to improve the sensitivity to 0νββ with the upcoming [CUPID](/projects/CUPID) experiment, I have led the design of the muon veto system for background reduction and I am currently working on improving the energy resolution through noise reduction.

I got my Ph.D. from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago working on the [PROSPECT](https://prospect.yale.edu/) reactor neutrino experiment leading the design, fabrication, QA, and assembly of the inner detector [subsystem](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/04/P04014) and led its [first sterile neutrino search](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.251801). Find more about [PROSPECT](/projects/PROSPECT/) and my [work](/projects/reactor) on reactor neutrinos.
