Hello, thanks for stopping by! :wave:

My name is Pranava. I am Postdoctoral Research Associate at Yale University working on understanding neutrino properties. 

Pranava got his PhD from Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago in 2019. During his PhD, he worked on the PROSPECT reactor neutrino experiment leading the design, fabrication, QA, and assembly of the inner detector subsystem and led its first sterile neutrino search. He then joined the Wright lab at Yale University as a postdoc working on the Project 8 neutrino mass experiment and CUORE neutrinoless double beta decay experiment while continuing to work on the PROSPECT experiment. On the Project 8, he is leading the antenna design and the event reconstruction efforts on the upcoming Phase of the experiment. On CUORE experiment, he is leading the design of the muon veto system that will eventually be used for CUPID, the next generation bolometric experiment searching for neutrinoless double decay.
